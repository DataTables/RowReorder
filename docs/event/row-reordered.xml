			jQuery event object

		<parameter type="array" name="details">
			An array of change objects for the row's how have had values effected. Each object contain the following properties:

			* `-type *` `newData` - The new data value for the row (data point defined by `rr-init rowReorder.dataSrc`)
			* `-type node` `node` - The `-tag tr` element
			* `-type integer` `newPosition` - New index in the DOM
			* `-type *` `oldData` - The old data value for the row
			* `-type integer` `oldPosition` - Old index in the DOM
		</parameter>
		<parameter type="object" name="edit">
			This parameter provides the information required for [Editor](//editor.datatables.net) to perform a multi-row edit:

			* `-type string` `dataSrc` - Data point - typically the field to be edited (defined by `rr-init rowReorder.dataSrc`)
			* `-type array` `nodes` - The rows to be edited
			* `-type object` `values` - The new values in a format suitable for `e-api multiSet()`.
			* `-type DataTable.Api` `triggerRow` (Since v1.1.0) - Row API instance for the row that was used to start the reorder (i.e. the result from `dt-api row()`).

	<description>
		The event data is identical to the `rr-event row-reorder` event. In comparison to the `rr-event row-reorder` event, the event will be triggered after the row is dropped and after the data is updated. 
		This event is only triggered if the `rr-init rowReorder.update` option has been enabled (which it is by default).

		The data that has been changed by RowReorder is given in two different forms in the parameters for the event handler callback - one with detailed information about the individual rows, and one with data in a format suitable for [Editor's](//editor.datatables.net) multi-row editing feature.

		Please note that, as with all DataTables emitted events, this event is triggered with the `dt` namespace. As such, to listen for this event, you must also use the `dt` namespace by simply appending `.dt` to your event name, or use the `dt-api on()` method to listen for the event which will automatically append this namespace.
