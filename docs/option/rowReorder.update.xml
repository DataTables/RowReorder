	<description>
		At the end of a row reordering action you will typically wish to take some action to reflect the change from the reordering action. By default RowReorder will read the data from the reordered rows and update that same data based on the row's new position in the table. It will then redraw the table to account for any changes in ordering.

		This action is not always desirable, particularly if you are using server-side processing or wish to have an external process update the data. In such circumstances this option can be used to disable the automatic data update and draw. The `rr-event row-reorder` event can then be used to determine what actions should be taken based on the reordered rows.
