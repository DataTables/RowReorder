			Offset from the left of the table that the horizontal position is locked to. This can be a positive number (offset to the right) or a negative number (offset to the left).

	<description>
		When RowReorder starts a drag, it clones the original target row and the clone is moved with the mouse, giving the end user visual feedback about the drag action.

		By default the cloned row will be moved with the mouse both horizontally and vertically. However, only the virtual position is particularly important and it can be nice to lock the row to the host table vertically. This option provides that ability.
